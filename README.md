# MovieDB Angular App üé¨

This project uses **The Movie Database (TMDB) API** to display trending movies, people, TV shows, and more!

Users must log in to fetch data using a secure token, and can explore details for each item.

## Features ‚ú®

* **Navbar** with 4 main pages:
  * **List Page** : Displays trending content (movies, TV shows, people).
  * **People Page** : Displays popular people.
  * **Movies Page** : Displays trending movies.
  * **TV Page** : Displays trending TV shows.
* **Authentication** :
* User must log in first to retrieve a token.
* Token is used to access protected API endpoints.
* **Card View** :

  Each item card shows:

* Image (Poster/Profile)
* Title/Name
* Rating
* Short description (if available)
* **Details Page** :
* Clicking on any card navigates to a detailed view of the selected item.
* Details include extended information like overview, release date, language, and more.

## API Reference üîó

* Main API documentation: [TMDB API Docs](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started)
* Example endpoint for trending data:

  ```
  https://api.themoviedb.org/3/trending/all/{time_window}
  ```

## How it works üöÄ

1. **User Authentication** :

* User logs in and receives a token.

1. **Dark Theme** :

* Modern dark UI for a clean, cinematic look.
